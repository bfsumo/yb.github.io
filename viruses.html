    <h3>Viruses invade healthy cells and make us ill</h3>

    <!-- paragraph -->
    <p><strong>Unlike bacteria, viruses have no cells of their own</strong>. This means that they're not, strictly speaking, living organisms. Instead, they're made up of one or more molecules surrounded by a protein shell. The genetic information found inside this shell is needed for the viruses to reproduce.</p>
    <p>Many viruses are responsible for diseases. Some are harmless and only trigger a minor cold, while others can cause serious diseases like AIDS. Other diseases caused by viruses include influenza ("the flu"), measles or inflammation of the liver (viral hepatitis).</p>
    <p>Viruses invade healthy cells and start to multiply from these cells. <strong>A virus can't reproduce without these host cells</strong>. Not all viruses cause symptoms, and in many cases the body successfully fights back against the attackers. This is the case with cold sores, which many people have experienced at some time. They are caused by viruses that are found in certain nerve cells and can lead to the typical blisters in some people if their immune system is weak or run-down.</p>
    <p>It's relatively difficult to fight viruses with medication. To protect against some viruses, the immune system can be “trained” by a vaccination so that the body is better prepared to fight the virus.</p>
