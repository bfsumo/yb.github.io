    <h2>What are microbes?</h2>

        <p><strong>Microbes</strong>, or microorganisms, are tiny living things that are found all around us and are too small to be seen by the naked eye. They live in water, soil, and in the air. The human body is home to millions of these microbes too.</p>
        <p>The category ‘Microbes’ includes a massive range of organisms including <strong>bacteria, fungi, viruses, algae, archaea and protozoa</strong>.</p>
        <p>The vast majority of microbes on the earth pose no real threat to humans, plants or animals; in fact they actually work alongside humans to make world go round, <i>aiding decomposition, decay and even helping us to digest our food. However, there are some microorganisms which negatively impact our lives, causing illness, bad odours and damaging products and surfaces.</i> Some of the names we  regularly hear in the media are Salmonella, E.Coli, MRSA, Malaria and Bird flu.</p>
        <p>We will briefly explore some major divisions within microorganisms, and hopefully highlight some interesting facts and differences within each group.</p>
