    <!-- paragraph -->
    <p>Fungi can live in lots of different environments. The best-known fungi include <strong>yeast</strong>,<strong> mold</strong> and edible fungi like <strong>mushrooms</strong>. Just like bacteria, some fungi occur naturally on the skin or in the body. But fungi can also cause diseases.</p>
    <p>Diseases caused by fungi are called mycoses. Common examples include athlete’s <stong>foot</stong> or fungal infections of the <strong>nails</strong>. Fungal infections can sometimes also cause inflammations of the <stong>lungs</stong>, or of mucous membranes in the <strong>mouth</strong> or on the <strong>reproductive organs</strong>, and become life-threatening for people who have a weakened immune system.</p>
    <p>But humans have also benefited from the helpful qualities of some fungi. We owe the discovery of penicillin to a type of mold that is used to produce this antibiotic.</p>
